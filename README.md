# 🤟 Sign Language Detection Web App

A real-time sign language recognition system built with Flask, OpenCV, and machine learning. This application captures sign gestures via webcam, predicts the corresponding alphabet using a trained ML model, and speaks the result using browser-based speech synthesis.

## 🌟 Features

- 🎥 Real-time webcam-based sign detection
- 🧠 Trained machine learning model (Random Forest)
- 💬 Automatic speech output of predicted sign
- 💻 Beautiful glassmorphic UI with Bootstrap 5
- 🧪 Speech synthesis integration (browser-based)
- 🛠️ Flask backend for model integration and video streaming
